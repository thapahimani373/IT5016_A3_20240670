The Employee Leave Management System is a Python based command-line application that helps manage employee leave requests in a simple, efficient, and transparent way. Instead of using paper forms or manual approvals, this system provides a straightforward way to submit, track, and process leave requests all in one place. The workflow has been kept intentionally straightforward so that employees and managers can interact with the system without unnecessary complexity. Employees begin by entering their details employee ID, name, number of leave days, and the reason for requesting leave. Once the application is submitted, the system evaluates it automatically. Requests that are shorter than three days are right away approved, giving employees a quick confirmation without any extra unessesary steps. If the request is for three or more days, the system places it in a pending state, waiting for a manager’s review. The manager can then approve or reject the request based on company policies, and the outcome is saved to the system. Every application is assigned a unique ID for tracking, stored in a central list, and can be displayed in detail or as a summary view. On top of that, the system generates clear statistics, showing the total number of applications as well as how many have been approved, rejected, or are still pending. This combination of automation and managerial control creates a balanced, reliable process that saves time for both staff and management.

One of the most valuable aspects of this project is that it was built with solid software design principles. These principles ensure that the program is not just functional but also clean, maintainable, and flexible enough for future updates. For instance, the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) has been applied so that each method in the program has one clear job, such as collecting input, processing decisions, or displaying information. This keeps the logic neat and prevents the code from becoming cluttered. The KISS principle (Keep It Simple, Stupid) is also applied by keeping the rules and conditions easy to follow—for example, a simple “under three days = auto-approve” rule keeps the workflow intuitive also uses that global counter for IDs. Encapsulation principle ensures that sensitive details like employee information and leave data are stored securely within the LeaveApplication class, the code carries the method like input employee_details()  only accessible through controlled methods. The system also demonstrates high cohesion, since all leave-related behavior and attributes are grouped logically together, and low coupling, since the main program only manages workflow without interfering directly with the internal details of each request.

Beyond these, the system applies the principle of Separation of Concerns by keeping input handling, decision-making, display functions, and statistics calculations in separate parts of the code. This makes the program easier to read and maintain. The design also follows the Information Expert principle, giving responsibility for processing leave requests to the class that actually contains all the relevant data. Finally, the system is built with flexibility and extensibility in mind. Because it already offers features like detailed and summary views or statistical breakdowns, it can easily be extended in the future to support new rules, advanced reporting, or even integration with external systems like HR databases.

In practice, the Employee Leave Management System creates a reliable and organized process that benefits both employees and managers. Employees get quick responses for short leaves, and managers have an easy way to review and track longer requests. The unique application IDs make tracking simple, and the central list ensures that no request is overlooked. Managers can view all requests in detail when needed, or switch to a summary view for a quick snapshot of the current situation. The automatically generated statistics add another layer of transparency, showing how many requests were made in total and how they were resolved. Because the system was built with strong design principles, it is not only effective in its current form but also ready for future growth. It stands as a good example of how thoughtful software design can turn a simple idea—like tracking leave requests—into a structured, efficient, and reliable system that people actually enjoy using.
