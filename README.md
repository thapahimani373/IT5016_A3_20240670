###How the System Works

Short Description In the Employee Leave Management System, all actions involve the employee requesting leave when he/she has typed his or her employee number, name, the number of leave days, and the purpose of the leave request. Upon employing the application, the system will automatically verify the application: in case the leave requested occupies fewer than three days; the status of the application immediately becomes approved; otherwise, the status becomes pending. The applications are then checked by a manager who may either approve or disapprove the leave. As the manager decides, the status of the application is updated as well. Any and every leave application including their aspects like employee details, days of leave, purpose of the leave as well as the status may be viewed either in detail or in a summary form. Lastly are overall statistics generated by the system, which contains the summary of all applications, approved applications, pending applications, and rejected applications. The systematic process has brought clarity, efficiency, and ease of tracking to the leave approval process.

Applied Software Design Principles.

To ensure that the code was clean, easy to maintain and scalable, the Employee Leave Management System adheres to some key software design rules:

Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): A single method should perform a single specific task like collecting the details of the employee, applying for leave, checking automatic approval, manager review, displaying the application details, calculating the statistics.

KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid): The process is not complicated and complex systems with some simple conditions to be satisfied to be automatically approved and help such decisions as yes/no are provided by the manager.

Encapsulation: Employee and leave information is hidden inside the LeaveApplication class and is accessed only through the class methods.

High Cohesion: An important aspect of the design pattern is to place leave application features in one class (the leaveapplication class).

Low Coupling: The workflow is managed by the main program itself without having the direct access to the internal data of the leave applications.

Information Expert: Now we have ' LeaveApplication class where all data required in processing the leave requests is saved.

Separation of Concerns: Modularity is implemented by separating input processing, decision logic, display, and statistics calculation into specific methods and functions.

Flexibility and Extensibility: There are summary/ full display features and dynamic statistics which allow the easy adaptation of the system to the future needs.
