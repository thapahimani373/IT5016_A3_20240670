# IT5016 Programming Principles Repository

This repo explores programming principles with Python examples. I created these codes to learn and analyze how they make code easy to maintain and extend.

## Principles Explored
1. **Encapsulation**: Hides data like balance in a bank account. See Encapsulation/bank_account.py. Analysis: Keeps code safe and easy to update without breaking other parts. I like how it protects data.

2. **Inheritance**: Reuses code, like animals sharing traits. See Inheritance/animals.py. Analysis: Saves time but needs care to avoid confusion. I found it fun to add Dog and Cat.

3. **Abstraction**: Hides complex details, like area math. See Abstraction/shape.py. Analysis: Simplifies use and is extendable. I struggled at first but now see its value.

4. **Polymorphism**: Same method, different actions. See Polymorphism/vehicles.py. Analysis: Makes code flexible and reusable. I enjoyed testing it with Car and Boat.

5. **SOLID (Single Responsibility)**: One job per class. See SOLID/user_manager.py. Analysis: Keeps code clean and fixable. Research shows it cuts bugs, which helps my practice.

## How These Relate to My Practice
I wrote these codes to practice. They help build maintainable software â€“ like encapsulation in real apps. I learned from geeksforgeeks.org and added my thoughts.

## What I Learned
These principles turn messy code into neat, professional work. I analyzed: Without them, adding features gets hard and buggy. This repo shows my research and practice together.
