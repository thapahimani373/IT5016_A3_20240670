Employee Leave Management System is a python based command line program that assists in managing employee leave requests in simple, efficient and transparent manner. Rather than the paper forms or manual approvals, this system offers an easy method to make a leave request, track and process it all in a single location. The workflow has also been maintained at a deliberately simple level to enable the employees and managers to relate to the system without any undue complexity. The employees will start with typing their information employee ID, name, number of days of leave and why they are requesting the leave. After one submits the application, the system then evaluates it automatically. The requests less than 3 days are automatically granted which provides employees with a fast confirmation and does not require any unnecessary additional procedures. In case of three or more days, the system will put the request in wait mode pending a review by a manager. The manager is then free to accept or deny the request depending on the company policy and the answer is stored in the system. All applications are given a special ID to keep track of them and this is kept in a central list which can be shown on a list detailing every application or in the form of summary. Besides that, the system will create clear statistics providing the total number of applications straight off the bat and the number that has been approved, rejected, or is still pending. Such an automation and control by managers will bring about a balanced and reliable process, which saves time to both staff and management.

The best thing about this project is that this was constructed using sound software design concepts. These principles will assure that the program will not only be functional, but also clean, maintainable, and flexible enough so that it can be updated in the future. As an example, the Application of Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) has been implemented in a way that there is a single job in every method of the program e.g. collecting input, decisions / processing decisions, displaying information. This makes the logic clean and does not clutter the code. The KISS principle (Keep It Simple, Stupid) is also put in place by ensuring that the rules and conditions are simple to understand such as under three days = auto-approve rule makes the workflow intuitive also ID counter is global. Encapsulation principle also makes sure that sensitive information such as the information about employees and leave data are at a safe place in the LeaveApplication class, the code contains the method such as input_employee_details() or show_details this is to protect data and to be able to offer a clean interface. The system is also highly cohesive as all behavior and attributes associated with leaves are logically bundled and loosely coupled since the main portion of the program merely facilitates the processing of a workflow without making any direct call to the internal implementation of any particular request.

Besides, the system uses the concept of Separation of Concerns by storing input handling, decision-making, display functions and statistics calculations in different sections of the code. Display statistics() This simplifies the reading and maintenance of this program. The design is also based on the Information Expert principle whereby the processing of leave request is handled in the class which holds all the information required. Lastly, the system is developed in a flexible and extensible way. Since it already supports such features as detailed and summary view or statistical breakdowns, it is easily scalable in the future to add new rules, more advanced reporting or even to integrate with other systems.

As a matter of fact, the Employee Leave Management System establishes a stable and structured procedure that is of benefit to employees and managers. Short leaves are responded swiftly to employees and long leaves can be easily reviewed and tracked by managers. The application IDs are unique and thus tracking is easy and the central list is used to ensure that no request is missed out. Managers also have the ability to look at every request in finer details when required or use a summary view which gives them a glimpse of the situation at hand. The statistics that are created automatically will provide an additional degree of transparency, displaying the number of requests that were made overall and the way they were addressed. Due to the high design principles applied in the construction of the system, the system is not only efficient as it is today but is also prepared to expand in the future. It is an example of how well-considered software design can transform a rather mundane concept such as a system to keep track of leave requests into a well-organized, effective, and dependable system that people will even love to use.
