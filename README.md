Employee Leave Management System was a Python based and simple to use console style application that was created as means to ease, simplify and shed light into the pending process of managing employee leave requests, to the employees themselves as well as the management team. This system does not use paper for any applications or manual approval because they are all integrated in a system so simple that requests may be submitted and changes on the requests are mostly tracked with the request all carried out in an organized manner. This has kept the workflow consciously simple to achieve the goal of ensuring that the workforce and managers interact with the system without being overly complicated. It begins when the employees enter their details in the system including employee ID, name, their days of leave and the purposes behind their requests to get leave. Once the application is posted the system will automatically vet the application. requisitions not exceeding three days in length are granted at once and are that is, they are made immediately with no due process being followed when Requests of over three days are made they are placed in one of the pending states awaiting completion by a manager. Subsequently it then becomes the business of the manager to either approve or disapprove the request based on the company regulations and the outcome yielded will be keyed to the system. Each application is assigned unique tracking ID, and assembled in a master list and could be presented as a list or as a summary. In addition to that a clear statistics of the total number of applications and its approved and rejected ones and pending is availed in the system. Automation and manager control are sure to create a familiar and dependable process that saves time on both the employee and the management side.

The ideal aspect of this project is that good software design was considered in its development. These qualities are designed to make the program not only reasonable, but clean, supportable and have the abilities to be updated to the remote future. Actually, Single Responsibility Principle(SRP) has been applied by way of which each and every method within the computer program has only one unambiguous responsibility: that of collection of inputs, keeping decisions, or presentation of the data. This is to ensure that the code is clean and is not a cluttered code. The other rule is the KISS principle (Keep It Simple Stupid) which it uses to model simulated code like eg. (all applications = ) and global counter id to model simple, yet comprehensible, and whereas loops and one-line accepting the output, the KISS rule is used to model simple and understandable results. _{ Rule, Method: the input of employee details or input of show the information is to provide certainty that the details are safeguarded and provide a simple interface this provides a guarantee that sensitive information like the employee data and working leave data remains secure in the LeaveApplication class that can only be accessed through the usage of controlled method. The system has high product-offset connections, that is, all behaviours, as well as any attributes, associated with leaves, are tightly grouped together; and low-connection, such that, what occurs within the workflow is the main program, which does not care about the details of the inner workings of each request.

Furthermore, the system employs the principle of Separation of Concerns because processing of the input, making decisions, presented functions, and calculating statistics tributes are not located in the same parts of the code. This makes the program easier to sustain. The design, likewise, follows the principle of Information Expert principle in that the processing of leaving requests is assigned to the class that already possesses all the data. Finally, the system will be built in a flexible and wide manner. Because it is already somewhat doing a few functions like detailed view or even summary views or even statistical/break downs, it can be easily extended later to take into consideration new rules as well as even somewhat providing advanced reporting or even customization with other systems like HR databases.

In fact the Employee Leave Management System produces a functional and systematic process which is of service both to the employee and the managers. Fast leaves are responded to and the managers can easily check and monitor longer leaves submitted by employees. The application IDs allow easy tracking of the application, and the central list ensures that no application is lost. As it is infrequently necessary, the managers will receive a possibility to see each request separately and in case they should rapidly overview of the situation, they will be educated by the summary. The statistics which needed to be created introduce another level of visibility to view the number of requests overall, which is how they were coupled up and dissolved. It is not only operable but also future growth may even be anticipated because of the strong building blocks upon which the system was established. It is a good example of how clever coding of software programs will enable, literally effortlessly, such a concept, as the keeping of leave requests to become a workable, systematized, and boilerplate system that individuals will desire to work with.
